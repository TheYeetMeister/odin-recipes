        <h3>For the Tangzhong, you will need to:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Add all the Tanhzhong ingredients together in your sauce pan</li>
            <li>Place your sauce pan on the stove and whisk your ingredients together</li>
            <li>Turn on your stove to about medium heat</li>
            <li>Continually whisk your ingredients together until your mixture thickens dramatically, or becomes a paste</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the Dough:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Grab your 1/2 cup, or 120 grams, of milk and heat it to about 95 degrees fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Add your 1 tablespoon, or 9 grams, of instant yeast to your milk and stir it</li>
            <li>Leave your Milk-yeast mixture in a warm area to sit for about 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Grab your stand mixer bowl and add your 5/2 cups, or 320 grams, of bread flour, 1 teapsoon, or 7 grams, of fine sea salt, and 5/2 tablesppons, or 35 grams, of granulated sugar and whisk those ingredients together to ensure they are throughly incoporated</li>
            <li>Place the stand mixer bowl back into the stand mixer, and make sure your stand mixer has its dough hook attachment on and turn your stand mixer on at low speed</li>
            <li>While your standm mixer is running, go ahead and slowly pour in your milk-yeast mixture and let it run for a few seconds</li>
            <li>Add your Tangzhong paste in</li>
            <li>Add in one whole egg, preferably at room temperature </li>
            <li>Add in one egg yolk, preferably at room temperature</li>
            <li>Increase your stand mixer speed from low to medium-low</li>
            <li>Then mix everything until it's throughly incoporated</li>
            <li>You will most likely need to scrape down the sides when it's mixing, so when you do so <strong>ensure the stand mixer is off to ensure your safety, and that you do not lose any fingers</strong> I am not liable for any body parts you lose during this process</li>
            <li>Once incorporated gradully add 3 tablespoons, or 42 grams, of unsalted, soft butter, <em>don't add it all in at once as it will take longer to incoporate if you do so</em></li>
            <li>Once everything is incorporate continue to let the stand mixer run for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Now take your bowl and lightly grease it</li>
            <li>Now take your dough and gently fold and place it seam side down on your work surface and sort of rub it around in a circle keeping constant constant contact with the board so that it folds in on itself and creates nice tension in the dough</li>
            <li>Place your dough into yourgreased bowl</li>
            <li>Grab your towel and wet it</li>
            <li>Place your damp towel on top of your bowl to cover your dough</li>
            <li>Place your towel covered bowl in a warm area for about 1 to 1 and a half hours, you can place the the towel-covered bowl in a turned off oven with the lights on for a warm enviorment</li>
            <li>Once the dough has doubled punch your dough down to deflate it</li>
            <li>Gently flour your work surface</li>
            <li>Place your dough on the floured work surface</li>
            <li>Divide your dough into 6 even pieces, to ensure they are accurately even each dough should weigh about 95-105 grams each</li>
            <li>Grab your a section of your dough and gently stretch and fold it towards the center repeat that around the whole segment of dough then flip it over so it's seam side down</li>
            <li>Now you can give the dough tension by pulling the dough towards you by keeping constatnt contact with your work surface</li>
            <li>Rotate your dough 90 degrees and repeat the previous step</li>
            <li>Continue doing the previous 2 steps until your dough is nice and circular</li>
            <li>Repeat the last 3 steps for all 6 of your burger bun doughs</li>
            <li>Place all 6 of your dough balls evenly spaced out on a rimmed baking sheet tray lined with lightly greased parchment paper</li>
            <li>Ensure that the dough balls are spaced apart enough, and they have about 2 and a half inches or six centimeters apart</li>
            <li>Once spaced apart enough, place another equally sized rimmed baking sheet, <strong>inverted</strong>,on top of your current baking sheet to keep them from drying out and allowing them to rise</li>
            <li>Allow them to rise at about room temperature for about 1 to 2 hours or until they've at least doubled in size</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Although it's good to go to the kitchen and whip up a tasty meal, it's also important to watch and moderate what you eat, to ensure a healthy lifestyle and happy life!</p>

        <p>You do not have to follow the Healthy Eating Plate diagram to a T, but it should give you a general idea of what you should eat and how much of it you should eat if you want to maintain a healthy, and happy life style, and remember diet alone isn't going to be enough, having good exercise and keeping your body, mind, and spirit active is also what will keep you fit, healthy, and happy!</p>

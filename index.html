        <p>Although it's good to go to the kitchen and whip up a tasty meal, <strong>it's also important to watch and moderate what you eat</strong>, to ensure a healthy lifestyle and happy life!</p>

        <p>You do not have to follow the Healthy Eating Plate diagram to a T, but <em>it should give you a general idea of what you should eat and how much of it you should eat if you want to maintain a healthy, and happy life style</em>, and remember <strong>diet alone isn't going to be enough, having good exercise and keeping your body, mind, and spirit active is also what will keep you fit, healthy, and happy!</strong></p>
